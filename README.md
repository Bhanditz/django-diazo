============
Django Diazo
============

Integrate Diazo in Django using Django- or WSGI-middleware and control themes using the Django Admin interface.

The code is maintained on GitHub (https://github.com/Goldmund-Wyldebeast-Wunderliebe/django-diazo).

------------
Installation
------------

Install the package::

    pip install django-diazo


~~~~~~~~~~~~
settings.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the app to your project::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_diazo',
        ...
    )

Add Django middleware::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        'django_diazo.middleware.DjangoDiazoMiddleware',
        ...
    )


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
wsgi.py (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may choose to use wsgi middleware instead of the Django middleware::

    # Apply WSGI middleware here.
    from django_diazo.wsgi import DiazoMiddlewareWrapper
    application = DiazoMiddlewareWrapper(application)


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Database (South migrations)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Migrate the database::

    python manage.py migrate django_diazo


-----------------------
Create a built-in theme
-----------------------

You might want to supply your Django application with an out-of-the-box
theme, probably also managed in a VCS.

Create a new app with a ``diazo.py`` file in its root. The contents of
this file is should be something like this::

    from django_diazo.theme import DiazoTheme, registry

    class BootstrapTheme(DiazoTheme):
        name = 'Bootstrap Theme'
        slug = 'bootstrap_theme'
    registry.register(BootstrapTheme)

Don't forget to put your assets in the static folder, like an ``index.html`` and a ``rules.xml``. You can find a
``rules.xml`` example in ``django_diazo/examples``.

To synchronize the built-in themes with the database/application run the
following command::

    python manage.py syncthemes


-------------
Upload themes
-------------

By default, the .zip files that are uploaded are extracted in the media
folder. You might want to serve these files via Django. Add the
following to your ``urls.py``::

    urlpatterns += patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^media/(?P<path>.*)$', 'django.views.static.serve', {'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT}),
        ...
    )

For production environments it is not recommended to serve files from
the media folder. This implementation only servers files in the
``themes`` folder within the media folder but it would be better to
serve these files using a web server and not via Django.
The same holds for your ``static`` folder.

Example themes / application

Take a look at https://github.com/Goldmund-Wyldebeast-Wunderliebe/django-diazo-themes and
https://github.com/Goldmund-Wyldebeast-Wunderliebe/django-diazo-blog for examples of built-in themes and an integration
example.

Our blog post http://www.goldmund-wyldebeast-wunderliebe.com/tech-blog/blog-posts/using-diazo-in-django also covers
these examples and some more background.
